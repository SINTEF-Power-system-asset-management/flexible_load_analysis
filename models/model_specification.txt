Models must be stored in this folder (models) and take as input a dictionary of 
timeseries, of which at least one is labelled "load" for load-measurements.
The model must also take an (optionally empty) dictionary of parameters.

The output of the modelling-module must be a dictionary of the modelled load,
labelled "load" and any biproducts from modelling "biproducts".
