# Stochastic Load Analysis

Stochastic Load Analysis is a Python script for performing load modelling,
with a focus on the method described in 
[Erling TÃ¸nne's Doctoral Thesis](http://hdl.handle.net/11250/2476389). 
The script is created by SINTEF Energi AS in conjunction with CINELDI WP1.

## Installation

The script is installed by cloning this repository to your own local machine.
Running the script requires the following dependencies:

### Dependencies
* Python 3
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#)
* [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [toml](https://toml.io/en/)

## Usage

To use this script, change config.toml to reflect placement and structure of
dataset, as well as changing any other fields.
After this, the program may be ran by running
```Bash
python main.py
```

See the source-code for how to implement custom preprocessing-steps as well
as other models.

## Development
Development follows issues reported at the project's 
[Jira](https://jira.code.sintef.no/projects/CINELDI/summary).

The project follows PEP8-styling and numpy 
[docstring-styling](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
